        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>

                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put beef cubes in a container with a lid. Whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 4 minced garlic cloves, wine, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, 1 teaspoon black pepper, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until marinade is well mixed; pour over beef. Allow beef to marinate, 10 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon fish sauce, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon black pepper together in a bowl until dipping sauce is well mixed.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; add beef and marinade. Cook and stir beef mixture, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, and 4 cloves minced garlic together in hot oil until beef is cooked through and sauce begins to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Adding garlic over several times during cooking will produce a better mix of flavors.</li>
                <li>Serve beef alongside dipping sauce.</li>
